What can i say about Astana.It is a strange city and even after two visits I am still not sure whether
I like it or not. For sure it is the opposite of what you might have seen in Borat. There are plenty 
of things to do in Astana. The city is super modern and one of the newest capitals in the world. 
Sometime also dubbed the Dubai of the steppes in Central Asia qwrt.
